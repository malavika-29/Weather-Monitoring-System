# Weather-Monitoring-System
The aim of this project is to design and implement a compact IoT-based Weather Monitoring System that measures temperature, humidity, and rain conditions in real time.  The data is displayed on an LCD screen and sent to the Blynk IoT platform for remote  monitoring through a smartphone.
